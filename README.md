# Beam-deflection-Analysis--Numerical-methods-vs-Machine-learning
The project is about finding beam deflection using numerical methods and machine learning approach to compare the results 

**Overview**

This project demonstrates how numerical methods and machine learning can be applied to solve real-world engineering problems. Specifically, it focuses on solving the beam deflection equation:

where  represents the deflection (in meters). This equation models the deflection of a beam under load, accounting for stiffness, material resistance, and external forces.

**Motivation**

In structural engineering, predicting and analyzing beam deflection is critical to ensure safety and optimal design. While numerical methods have been the standard for such calculations, machine learning offers a modern approach to predict solutions efficiently based on prior data, making it suitable for more complex cases.

**Objectives**

Solve the beam deflection equation using:

Bisection Method

False Position Method

Fixed Point Iteration Method

Newton-Raphson Method

Train a machine learning model to predict deflection based on load parameters.

Compare the results from numerical methods and machine learning predictions with the exact solution.

**Methods**

1. Bisection Method

Divides the interval into two halves and iteratively narrows the range containing the root.

Guarantees convergence if .

2. False Position Method

Uses a straight-line approximation between two points to estimate the root.

3. Fixed Point Iteration Method

Transforms the equation into  and iteratively converges to the root.

4. Newton-Raphson Method

Uses the tangent at a current guess to rapidly converge to the root.

5. Machine Learning Model

Implements a regression model to predict deflection using data generated from the equation.
